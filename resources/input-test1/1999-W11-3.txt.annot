Blaming the Seals March 10 , 1999

The Newfoundland government has a new weapon in its fight to increase the seal hunt : film of cod carnage .

{NonExp_0_Arg1 Underwater footage shows `` tens of thousands of cod lying on the bottom , gutted . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_0_Arg2_EntRel It looks pretty bad , '' {Attr_0 says Mary MacNab , the government 's seal industry promotions officer . NonExp_0_Arg2} Attr_0}

`` From my own impression , it 's the killing fields . ''

{Exp_0_Arg1 The footage , filmed last week by fishermen using government supplied equipment , shows the ocean floor Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous after Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 a group of seals crowded cod into a bay and started feasting . Exp_0_Arg2}

Lloyd Oldford of Red Cliff , Bonavista Bay , a fisherman who first alerted Efford to the problem , {Attr_1 said Attr_1} the video in no way shows the true extent of the destruction fishermen are seeing .

{NonExp_1_Arg1 `` I can show you 100 miles of it , '' {Attr_2 said Oldford . NonExp_1_Arg1} Attr_2}
{NonExp_2_Arg1 {NonExp_1_Arg2_EntRel `` There 's nothing but dead fish in every crook and cranny . NonExp_1_Arg2} NonExp_2_Arg1}
{NonExp_2_Arg2_EntRel It 's everywhere , massive destruction . NonExp_2_Arg2}

{NonExp_3_Arg1 It 's taking away a great source of income from us . NonExp_3_Arg1}
{NonExp_3_Arg2_Cause {Exp_1_conn_Condition If Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 we do n't do something about this seal problem , Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 more people are going to be leaving the province . '' Exp_1_Arg1} NonExp_3_Arg2}

{Attr_3 John Efford , Attr_3} Newfoundland 's fisheries minister , {Attr_4 says Attr_4} the `` very disturbing '' images will wake up people to the toll seals are taking on northern cod stocks .

There has been a moratorium - a temporary ban - on {Exp_2_Arg1 fishing for cod since 1992 Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Asynchronous after Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels Exp_2_Arg2} .

{Exp_5_Arg1 {Exp_3_Arg1 `` We thought by bringing in the moratorium , that in a few years the cod stocks would start to return , '' {Attr_5 he says . Exp_3_Arg1} Exp_5_Arg1} Attr_5}

{Exp_5_Arg2 {Exp_4_Arg1 {Exp_3_Arg2 `` {Exp_3_conn_Contrast But Exp_3_conn} seven years {Exp_4_conn_Asynchronous after Exp_4_conn} {Exp_4_Arg2 the closure of the ground fish industry , stocks today are worse Exp_4_Arg2} {Exp_5_conn_Asynchronous then Exp_5_conn} they were previous to 1992 . Exp_3_Arg2} Exp_4_Arg1} Exp_5_Arg2}

`` There 's only one answer to that ... We 've got an overpopulated seal herd . ''

{Attr_6 {NonExp_4_Arg1 Mr. Efford says Attr_6} the seal herd , which is estimated at six million , needs to be cut in half . NonExp_4_Arg1}
{NonExp_4_Arg2_EntRel That would mean increasing the annual quota of 275,000 harp seals to between 475,000 and 575,000 animals . NonExp_4_Arg2}

Jeff Hutchings , a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax , {Attr_7 Nova Scotia says Attr_7} it is a stretch for Mr. Efford to use evidence of seals preying on cod in one location to argue for a massive cull -LRB- harvest -RRB- of the seal herd .

{NonExp_5_Arg1 `` The degree to which seals are retarding the recovery of cod stocks remains an open question . NonExp_5_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg1 {NonExp_5_Arg2_Cause Maybe they are . NonExp_5_Arg2} NonExp_6_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg2_Cause Maybe they are n't . '' NonExp_6_Arg2}

{Attr_8 He adds that documentation of seals having eaten Attr_8} only the fish stomachs suggests scientists may have underestimated how many cod the seals kill .

{Exp_6_Arg1 Researchers detect traces of fish in seal stomachs only Exp_6_Arg1} {Exp_6_conn_Condition if Exp_6_conn} {Exp_6_Arg2 they eat the whole fish . Exp_6_Arg2}

{NonExp_7_Arg1 Today , sealing comprises a vital part of Newfoundland 's sluggish economy . NonExp_7_Arg1}
{NonExp_7_Arg2_Instantiation In 1996 alone it was worth in excess of $ 11 million , with seal products being sold in Canada , Norway and Asia . NonExp_7_Arg2}
