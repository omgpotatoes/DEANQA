Scientists find dinosaur bones in Antarctica July 9 , 1999

Scientists in the Antarctic have discovered some very old dinosaur bones , including partial skeletons , whole jaws and teeth .

The remains include the bones of two giant water dinosaurs : the mosasaur , a razor-toothed `` duck-bill '' animal with paddles , and the plesiosaur , which scientists say looks like Scotland 's legendary Loch Ness monster .

American geologists made the find in January , but did not announce the discovery until this week at an international earth sciences meeting in Wellington , New Zealand .

{Exp_0_Arg1 The find shows that at least four different types of mosasaur lived in the Antarctic . Exp_0_Arg1}
{Exp_0_Arg2 One type had {Exp_0_conn_Asynchronous previously Exp_0_conn} been found only in North America and Europe . Exp_0_Arg2}

Mosasaurs have been found across the world from Sweden to New Zealand , but never in Antarctica .

{NonExp_0_Arg1 The mosasaur discovery shows the Antarctic was once much warmer than it is now . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{Attr_0 {NonExp_0_Arg2_EntRel The scientists believe Attr_0} the creatures probably came to the Antarctic around 75 million or 80 million years ago . NonExp_0_Arg2}

{NonExp_1_Arg1 Mosasaurs were around 10 metres long . NonExp_1_Arg1}
{NonExp_1_Arg2_Cause Their huge skulls were filled with 10 centimetre long teeth . NonExp_1_Arg2}

A team at an American museum are studying the fossils .
