Newfoundland workers look into mystery illness
July 21, 1999


Fish plant workers in Newfoundland are concerned about a work hazard called "shellfish asthma." 

The illness, which appears unique to this kind of work, is an allergy that gives a person flu-like symptoms. 
It can happen to workers who are exposed to crab and shrimp meat. 

The fishing industry is important to the Newfoundland economy, and way of life. 
However, in recent years environmental concerns have forced the government to place limits on how many fish can be caught. 

Due to these limits, finding a fishing industry job in Newfoundland is tough. 
Crab and shrimp have become important to the Newfoundland fishing industry. 
Shellfish plants have created some important jobs that help replace the ones that were lost. 
Many workers are trying to live with their symptoms so they can keep their jobs at the fish plants. 

But the union representing plant workers says shellfish asthma is a real workplace disease. 
They feel there should be protection for employees who have trouble working because of shellfish asthma. 

There has been almost no research on shellfish asthma. 

The union that represents the workers is trying to find out how many employees suffer from shellfish asthma symptoms. 
They will then join forces with the Canadian Auto Workers union to find out what can be done for people who have to give up their job.
