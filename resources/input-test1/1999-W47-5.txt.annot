{NonExp_1_Arg1 {Exp_0_Arg1 The Chinese woman ca n't be identified because of a legal order , Exp_0_Arg1} {Exp_0_conn_Contrast but Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 it seems her claim {Exp_1_Arg1 to be accepted Exp_1_Arg1} {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony as Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 a refugee to Canada may succeed where the claims of 32 people who arrived with her have failed Exp_1_Arg2} . Exp_0_Arg2} NonExp_1_Arg1}
{NonExp_1_Arg2_Cause They will be sent back to China . NonExp_1_Arg2}

{Attr_1 {NonExp_2_Arg1 The woman says Attr_1} that seven years ago she got pregnant for the second time . NonExp_2_Arg1}
{NonExp_3_Arg1 {NonExp_2_Arg2_EntRel That violates a Chinese law . NonExp_2_Arg2} NonExp_3_Arg1}
{NonExp_4_Arg1 {NonExp_3_Arg2_EntRel Couples in China are only allowed to have one child . NonExp_3_Arg2} NonExp_4_Arg1}
{NonExp_4_Arg2_Cause {Exp_2_Arg1 She tried to hide from the authorities , Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Contrast but Exp_2_conn} {Exp_3_Arg1 {Exp_2_Arg2 they found her {Exp_3_conn_Synchrony when Exp_3_conn} {Exp_3_Arg2 she was eight months pregnant Exp_3_Arg2} and took her to hospital Exp_3_Arg1} .

{NonExp_6_Arg1 {NonExp_5_Arg2_EntRel They put the baby in a bucket . NonExp_5_Arg2} NonExp_6_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg2_Cause {Exp_6_Arg1 {Exp_5_Arg1 {Exp_4_Arg1 I heard the baby crying for a short time {Exp_4_conn_Conjunction and Exp_4_conn} {Exp_4_Arg2 I wanted to hold the baby Exp_4_Arg2} Exp_5_Arg1} {Exp_5_conn_Contrast but Exp_5_conn} {Exp_5_Arg2 I could n't . Exp_4_Arg1} Exp_5_Arg2} Exp_6_Arg1} NonExp_6_Arg2}
{Exp_6_conn_Asynchronous Later Exp_6_conn} {Exp_6_Arg2 , the doctor told me the baby was no longer living . '' Exp_6_Arg2}

{NonExp_7_Arg1 {Exp_7_conn_Synchrony When Exp_7_conn} {Exp_7_Arg2 she heard a ship was going to Canada , Exp_7_Arg2} {Exp_7_Arg1 she decided to get on board . Exp_7_Arg1} NonExp_7_Arg1}
{NonExp_7_Arg2_EntRel She planned to seek refugee status and bring her husband and child . NonExp_7_Arg2}

{Exp_8_Arg1 So far , every refugee claim from the Chinese migrants has been rejected , usually Exp_8_Arg1} {Exp_8_conn_Cause because Exp_8_conn} {Exp_8_Arg2 the board has found no evidence of persecution . Exp_8_Arg2}

{Exp_9_Arg2 The woman {Exp_9_conn_Conjunction also Exp_9_conn} says her family received a notice {Exp_10_Arg1 that she 'll be sterilized Exp_10_Arg1} {Exp_11_Arg1 {Exp_10_conn_Cause so Exp_10_conn} {Exp_10_Arg2 she ca n't have any more babies Exp_11_Arg1} {Exp_11_conn_Condition if Exp_11_conn} {Exp_11_Arg2 she returns to China Exp_10_Arg2} Exp_11_Arg2} .

{Exp_12_Arg1 Larry Smeets , her lawyer , {Attr_3 says Attr_3} the Federal Court of Appeal has concluded in the past that forced sterilization was a form of persecution Exp_12_Arg1} , {Exp_12_conn_Cause so Exp_12_conn} {Exp_12_Arg2 this reason could be recognized as a reason for refugees to be allowed to remain in Canada Exp_12_Arg2} .

{Exp_13_conn_Cause Since Exp_13_conn} {Exp_13_Arg2 there is little evidence beyond the woman 's own testimony , Exp_13_Arg2} {Exp_13_Arg1 the decision depends on whether the board members believe she is telling the truth . Exp_13_Arg1}
