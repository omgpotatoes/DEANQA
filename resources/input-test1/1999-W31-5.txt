First Man to be Buried on the Moon
July 30, 1999


Eugene Shoemaker may finally fulfill his lifelong wish to go to the moon. 

If all goes as planned on Saturday, a lipstick-sized container will carry his ashes to the moon's south pole. 

Shoemaker will be the first human to be laid to rest on another celestial body. 
His ashes will be aboard NASA's Lunar Prospector. 

The Lunar Prospector is a moon-orbiting craft. 
It is expected to crash land on the moon early Saturday morning. 
NASA is hopeful that the impact of Prospector's crash into the moon will create a plume of water which will be visible from Earth with a telescope. 
NASA scientists are hopeful that this experiment will help them learn about the moon's water reserves. 

Shoemaker was a well-known astronomer and geologist. 
He was considered an authority on craters and the collisions that cause them. 
He is credited with discovering about 20 comets and 800 asteroids. 
Shoemaker gained worldwide fame in 1994, when he helped discover the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The comet slammed into Jupiter in 1994. 

It was always Shoemaker's dream to go to the moon. 
He applied to be an astronaut in the 1960s, but was rejected because of a medical problem. 
He later worked on several U.S. space missions, including the Apollo missions to the moon. 
He taught Apollo astronauts about craters. 

Shoemaker said shortly before his death the biggest disappointment in his life was "not going to the moon and banging on it with my own hammer."
