Students and Clinton want Stricter Gun Control
July 16, 1999


American President Bill Clinton wants tougher gun control in the United States 
On Thursday, he had some help. 
About 95 students from across the United States made their way to the White House to help President Clinton convince the American government to put stricter controls on guns. 
Included in the group were six students from Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. 

In April, Columbine High School was the scene of the worst high school shooting in American history. 
Two teenage gunmen shot and killed 13 students. 
The gunmen then killed themselves. 

Clinton wants to pass new gun control laws before school starts in September. 
He wants to make it more difficult for people in the United States to get guns. 
By limiting access to guns, President Clinton hopes to put an end to school shootings like the one in Littleton. 

But it appears unlikely the students' efforts will have an immediate impact. 

Some members of the government are against gun control. 
They think violent video games and movies are more to blame for these incidents than guns. 

Some members of the public are opposed to gun control for another reason. 
They believe people should decide for themselves if they want to own a gun or not. 

These people who are against gun control plan to delay the creation of any new gun laws.
