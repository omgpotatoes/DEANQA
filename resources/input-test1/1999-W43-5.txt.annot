Manitoba Says No Way to YNN October 22 , 1999

The Youth News Network , a news show that airs in some Canadian schools , is in trouble in Manitoba .

YNN is a private company that gives schools free equipment - like televisions and computers - to make sure it has an audience for its commercial news service .
