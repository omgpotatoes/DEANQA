Scientists find dinosaur bones in Antarctica
July 9, 1999


Scientists in the Antarctic have discovered some very old dinosaur bones, including partial skeletons, whole jaws and teeth. 

The remains include the bones of two giant water dinosaurs: the mosasaur, a razor-toothed "duck-bill" animal with paddles, and the plesiosaur, which scientists say looks like Scotland's legendary Loch Ness monster. 

American geologists made the find in January, but did not announce the discovery until this week at an international earth sciences meeting in Wellington, New Zealand. 

The find shows that at least four different types of mosasaur lived in the Antarctic. 
One type had previously been found only in North America and Europe. 

Mosasaurs have been found across the world from Sweden to New Zealand, but never in Antarctica. 

The mosasaur discovery shows the Antarctic was once much warmer than it is now. 
The scientists believe the creatures probably came to the Antarctic around 75 million or 80 million years ago. 

Mosasaurs were around 10 metres long. 
Their huge skulls were filled with 10 centimetre long teeth. 

A team at an American museum are studying the fossils.
