Inuit Prisoners Learn New Ways February 26 , 1999

Inmates at a prison in Iqaluit , on Baffin Island in the North West Territories -LRB- soon to be Nunavut -RRB- are being given something that few prisoners in the world are allowed : guns .

The goal is to show some wayward Inuit the traditional ways .

{NonExp_0_Arg1 On a typical day in this northern community , a hunting party is about to head out . NonExp_0_Arg1}
{NonExp_0_Arg2_Instantiation This one includes two prisoners from the Baffin Correctional Centre -LRB- BCC -RRB- , both convicted of assault , both trying to reconnect with Inuit traditions and culture . NonExp_0_Arg2}

{NonExp_1_Arg1 Moshe Akavak , {Attr_0 a guard with the BCC says learning Attr_0} the traditional ways will help the prisoners ' rehabilitation . NonExp_1_Arg1}
{NonExp_1_Arg2_EntRel {Exp_0_Arg1 `` {Exp_0_conn_Condition If Exp_0_conn} {Exp_0_Arg2 they go out Exp_0_Arg2} , they keep themselves busy doing hunting , repairing equipment , it 's good for them . '' Exp_0_Arg1} NonExp_1_Arg2}

The party is hunting caribou , far from the city on the frozen tundra .

{NonExp_2_Arg1 Michael Evic is serving a two-year sentence for assault and other crimes . NonExp_2_Arg1}
{NonExp_3_Arg1 {NonExp_2_Arg2_EntRel Out on the tundra with the hunting party he aims at his prey with a high powered rifle . NonExp_2_Arg2} NonExp_3_Arg1}
{NonExp_4_Arg1 {NonExp_3_Arg2_Restatement His first shot misses . NonExp_3_Arg2} NonExp_4_Arg1}
{NonExp_5_Arg1 {NonExp_4_Arg2_EntRel He tries again . NonExp_4_Arg2} NonExp_5_Arg1}
{NonExp_5_Arg2_Cause This time he 's successful . NonExp_5_Arg2}

{Attr_1 {NonExp_6_Arg1 Inuit believe Attr_1} it takes more than killing an animal to become a hunter . NonExp_6_Arg1}
{NonExp_6_Arg2_EntRel What happens afterwards is just as important . NonExp_6_Arg2}

Part of the instruction is learning how to carefully skin and carve a caribou the way Inuit have always done it .

{NonExp_7_Arg1 {Exp_2_Arg1 {Exp_1_conn_Synchrony When Exp_1_conn} {Exp_1_Arg2 Moshe Akavak became a jail guard 16 years ago , Exp_1_Arg2} {Exp_1_Arg1 he was appalled Exp_2_Arg1} {Exp_2_conn_Cause so Exp_2_conn} {Exp_2_Arg2 many Inuit had lost their traditional skills . Exp_1_Arg1} Exp_2_Arg2} NonExp_7_Arg1}
{Attr_2 {NonExp_7_Arg2_Contrast He believes Attr_2} that 's why some became criminals . NonExp_7_Arg2}

`` Anything they learn from the land program , or from other people , of course , they will be willing to pass on to their children . ''

{NonExp_8_Arg1 He says over the years hundreds of prisoners have been given guns and knives and taught how to use them . NonExp_8_Arg1}
{NonExp_8_Arg2_EntRel {Exp_3_Arg1 There 's never been a problem . Exp_3_Arg1} NonExp_8_Arg2}
{Exp_3_Arg2 `` The more you trust other people , you {Exp_3_conn_Conjunction also Exp_3_conn} gain it back . '' Exp_3_Arg2}

{NonExp_9_Arg1 This is just one of the traditional hunting programs for prisoners . NonExp_9_Arg1}
{NonExp_10_Arg1 {NonExp_9_Arg2_Cause In the summer they go after seals . NonExp_9_Arg2} NonExp_10_Arg1}
{NonExp_10_Arg2_Cause Depending on how well they do they could be sent to an outpost camp where they 'll hunt and fish for months at a time . NonExp_10_Arg2}

{Exp_4_Arg1 It 's all very expensive , costing tens of thousands of dollars for equipment , clothing and supervision . Exp_4_Arg1}
{Attr_3 {Exp_4_conn_Contrast But Exp_4_conn} {Exp_4_Arg2 many believe Attr_3} it 's money well spent . Exp_4_Arg2}

{Exp_5_Arg1 `` Whenever you have inmates that come out of jail feeling good about themselves and wanting to succeed I {Attr_4 think Attr_4} that cost is well borne out in terms of perhaps reduced recidivism -LRB- a return to committing crimes -RRB- . Exp_5_Arg1}
{Exp_5_conn_Conjunction And Exp_5_conn} {Exp_5_Arg2 I think you have the chance for these people to return to their communities and contribute , '' {Attr_5 says John McKnight , Attr_5} warden of the center . Exp_5_Arg2}

{NonExp_11_Arg1 The prisoners , like Michael Evic , believe learning traditional hunting skills will straighten out their lives . NonExp_11_Arg1}
{NonExp_11_Arg2_EntRel `` I 'll just keep on working and go hunting on weekends and keep out of booze or drugs , that was my problem , '' {Attr_6 Evic says . NonExp_11_Arg2} Attr_6}
